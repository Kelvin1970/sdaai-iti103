The values in our target column are in MW (according to the documentation). Taking the square root of 20 MW results in approximately 4.5 MW. Each target value represents net hourly electrical energy output. So for each hour our model is off by 4.5 MW on average. According to this [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-get-an-intuitive-understanding-of-what-a-Kw-Mw-Gw-of-electricity-equates-to-in-real-life-terms) answer, 4.5 MW is equivalent to the heat power produced by 4500 handheld hair dryers. And this would add up if we tried to predict the total energy output for one day or a longer period. We can conclude that the an MSE of 20 MW is quite large. "
